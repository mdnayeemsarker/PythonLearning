#DSA with Python

#Data Structures
# Data Structures are a way of storing and organizing data in a computer.
# Python has built-in support for several data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
# Other data structures can be implemented using Python classes and objects, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
# In this tutorial we will concentrate on these Data Structures:
# Lists and Arrays
#   Stacks
#   Queues
#   Linked Lists
#   Hash Tables
#   Trees
#   Binary Trees
#   Binary Search Trees
#   AVL Trees
# Graphs


#Algorithms
# Algorithms are a way of working with data in a computer and solving problems like sorting, searching, etc.
# In this tutorial we will concentrate on these search and sort Algorithms:
# Linear Search
# Binary Search
# Bubble Sort
# Selection Sort
# Insertion Sort
# Quick Sort
# Counting Sort
# Radix Sort
# Merge Sort
