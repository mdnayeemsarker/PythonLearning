#Python Graphs

#Graph Representations
# A Graph representation tells us how a Graph is stored in memory.
# Different Graph representations can:
  # take up more or less space.
  # be faster or slower to search or manipulate.
  # be better suited depending on what type of Graph we have (weighted, directed, etc.), and what we want to do with the Graph.
  # be easier to understand and implement than others.
