#Python Try Except

# The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
# The except block lets you handle the error.
# The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
# The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

#Exception Handling
print("Exception Handling\n")
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")
