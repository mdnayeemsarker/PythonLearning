#Python Polymorphism

#Function Polymorphism
print('\nFunction Polymorphism')
# An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.
print('\nstring')
#String = For strings len() returns the number of characters:
x = "Hello World!"
print(len(x))


#Tuple
print('\nTuple')
# For tuples len() returns the number of items in the tuple:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(mytuple))

#Dictionary
print('\nDictionary')
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

print(len(thisdict))


#Class Polymorphism
print('\nClass Polymorphism')
# Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.
# For example, say we have three classes: Car, Boat, and Plane, and they all have a method called move():
class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Drive!")

class Boat:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")       #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747")     #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  x.move()


#Inheritance Class Polymorphism
print('\nInheritance Class Polymorphism')
# What about classes with child classes with the same name? Can we use polymorphism there?
# Yes. If we use the example above and make a parent class called Vehicle, and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle, the child classes inherits the Vehicle methods, but can override them:

class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Move!")

class Car(Vehicle):
  pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")       #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747")     #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  print(x.brand)
  print(x.model)
  x.move()
